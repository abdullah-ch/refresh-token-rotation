# Refresh Token Rotation
## API
API Link =  https://refresh-token-rotation.cyclic.app
## Introduction
The implementation of the refresh token rotation involves generating a new refresh token after every access token generation. This is done to improve security and protect against token abuse. The old refresh token is revoked once the new one is generated and saved in the database.
## Why use Refresh Token Rotation System over Plain Refresh Token Authentication System :

* **Improved Security**: A plain Refresh Token System is vulnerable to attacks where an attacker can steal a refresh token and use it indefinitely to access the user's account. In contrast, the Refresh Token Rotation System generates new refresh tokens with each request, making it harder for an attacker to use a stolen token.

* **Lower Risk of Token Leakage**: In a plain Refresh Token System, if a refresh token is leaked, an attacker can use it to access the user's account until the token expires. In contrast, the Refresh Token Rotation System generates new refresh tokens with each request, so even if a token is leaked, it will only be valid for a short period.

* **Better Control Over Token Expiration**: The Refresh Token Rotation System allows the server to control when refresh tokens expire, while in a plain Refresh Token System, refresh tokens usually have a fixed expiration time. This allows the server to revoke tokens if necessary and improves the overall security of the system.

* **Reduced Impact of Token Expiration**: In a plain Refresh Token System, if a refresh token expires, the user has to log in again to generate a new refresh token. In contrast, the Refresh Token Rotation System generates new refresh tokens automatically, so the user can continue to use the system without having to log in again.
* **Refresh Token Reuse Detection**: This mechanism adds an extra layer of security by detecting and rejecting attempts to reuse a refresh token that has already been used or is expired. This helps to prevent unauthorized access to user accounts and reduces the risk of token-based attacks such as token theft and replay attacks. By implementing this mechanism, your code can provide an additional level of protection to users' accounts and enhance the overall security of the system.
